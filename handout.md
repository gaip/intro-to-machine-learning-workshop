# Intro to Data Science Workshop

## Why are we here?
1. Intro to the Codeup experience
2. Overview of Data Science
3. Intro to visualizing, exploring, and modeling data

## Why Codeup?
1. Focus on student outcomes
2. Placement services and quality of network
3. Immersion works. Full-time, live, in-person instruction for 5 months works.

### What is Data Science?
- Interdisciplinary applied science at the intersection of programming, statistics, and business
- The application of the scientific method of hypothesis-experiment-analyze-repeat to analyze and infer outcomes from data. 
- A broad description of approaches ranging from business analysis and visualizations to machine learning and deep neural network analysis.
- An increasingly accessible field

### What *isn't* Data Science?
- Only statistics or only mathematics: let the computer compute and the people think
- Magic or inaccessible

### Isn't data science just statistics?
- "Future of Data Analysis", Tukey 1962, `https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoms/1177704711`
- "50 Years of Data Science" by Donoho, `https://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf`

### 3 keys to success that students get from Codeup
1. In addition to learning data science, students learn how to continue learning data science into the future
2. How to form and ask effective questions, find your own answers, and collaborate in the face of uncertainty (how to get really good at googling stuff and collaborating with people)
3. How to debug and troubleshoot using the scientific method

### 5 Ways to get the most out of this workshop
1. Engage with the material, engage with others
2. Ask questions
3. What you get out of this is a function of what you put into it
4. Treat each other with excellence
5. Try things out! Run code! Experiment with the material!

### 6 things you will get from today's workshop
1. An introduction to the Codeup experience
2. Overview of Data Science
3. Intro to popular data science libraries and methods in Python
4. Instructional materials and your own copies of the prepared learning environments
5. Time to practice with the material including guidance and support on exercises
6. Homework to continue your learning

### What we will *not* cover today
- Excel, R, SAS, SPSS, or any other statistical analysis tools
- Everything you need to know about statistics, data science, or Python
- 5 months worth of practice, exercises, training, and mentoring
- Perceptrons, neural networks, or deep learning (too much for a 4 hour intro)

### The five questions Data Science can answer
1. **How many or how much of something? What will sales be next year?**
2. Which category does this thing belong to: is this A or B?
3. What groups? Does grouping things provide additional insight? Who are our best customers?
4. Is this weird? Anomaly detection like looking for fraudulent transactions
5. What should we do next? Infer likely outcomes

### Some Data Science Methodologies

- **Regression** - predict housing prices

- Classification - predict customers who will churn

- Clustering - identify physical neighborhoods, identify similar species

- Time series analysis - forecast revenue, predict store item demand

- Anomaly Detection - detect fraudulent transactions, account takeovers 

- NLP - Siri, sentiment analysis, twitter bots, customer feedback

- Graph Analysis - social networks, web analytics, page rank

- Recommender Systems - netflix, amazon shopping

- Neural Networks / Deep Learning - image recognition, face recognition

## Intro to Programming in Python

## Setup your interactive learning environment
1. Create an account on `https://kaggle.com`
2. Go to `https://www.kaggle.com/ryanorsinger/intro-to-data-science`
3. Click "Fork" to make your own copy so you can experiment.
4. We will be running Python code inside a Jupyter Notebook

### Using Jupyter Notebooks

- Click into a cell to enter edit mode. You can edit text or edit code.
- `shift + enter` to run a cell of code. 
- Notebooks have command mode and edit mode
- From edit mode, type the `esc` key to enter command mode.
- Type `h` in command mode to get a list of keyboard shortcuts

### Data Science Workflow
1. Plan what questions you want to ask of the data.
2. Acquire
3. Prepare
4. Explore
5. Model
6. Deliver/present findings

### Vocabulary Key Terms



### Homework and next steps
- `https://www.kaggle.com/ryanorsinger/101-exercises` for deep practice in Python fundamentals
- Apply if you're interested in the program.
