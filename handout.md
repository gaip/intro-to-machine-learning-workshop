# Intro to Data Science Workshop

## Why are we here?
1. Intro to the Codeup experience
2. Overview of Data Science
3. Intro to visualizing, exploring, and modeling data. *We will do some machine learning today!*

###  Why Codeup?
- Focus on student outcomes
- Placement services and quality of network
- Immersion works. Full-time, live, in-person instruction for 5 months works.

### 3 keys to success that students get from Codeup

1. In addition to the curriculum, we teach how to keep learning by being a self directed learner.
2. How to form and ask effective questions, find your own answers, and collaborate in the face of uncertainty (how to get really good at googling stuff and collaborating with people)
3. How to present your findings to stakeholders. How to present yourself professionally as a practitioner.

### What is Data Science?
- Interdisciplinary applied science intersecting programming, statistics, and domain expertise
- The application of the scientific method of hypothesis-experiment-analyze-repeat to analyze and infer outcomes from data. 
- A broad description of approaches ranging from business analysis and visualizations to machine learning and deep neural network analysis.
- An increasingly accessible field

### What *isn't* Data Science?
- Only statistics or only mathematics: let the computer compute and the people think
- Inaccessible, perfect, or without error. 
- Free from ethical scrutiny. It deserves serious ethical scrutiny and consideration.

### Isn't data science just statistics?

### 5 things you will get from today's workshop
1. An introduction to the Codeup experience
2. Overview of Data Science
3. Lesson and hands-on exercises with creating a linear regression
4. Instructional materials and your own copies of the prepared learning environments
5. Homework to continue your learning

### The five questions Data Science can answer
1. How many or how much of something? What will sales be next year?
2. Which category does this thing belong to: Is this A or B?
3. What groups? Is there a clustering of the data that tells a story? Who are our best customers?
4. Is this weird? Anomaly detection like looking for fraudulent transactions
5. What should we do next? Infer likely outcomes

### Some Data Science Methodologies

- **Regression** - predict future sales, predict house prices, predict rainfall

- Classification - predict customers who will churn

- Clustering - identify physical neighborhoods, identify similar species

- Time series analysis - forecast revenue, predict store item demand

- Anomaly Detection - detect fraudulent transactions, account takeovers 

- NLP - Siri, sentiment analysis, twitter bots, customer feedback

- Graph Analysis - social networks, web analytics, page rank

- Recommender Systems - netflix, amazon shopping

- Neural Networks / Deep Learning - image recognition, face recognition

### Overview of Machine Learning

Broadly, machine learning is the process of using previous data as the fuel for determining rules for making predictions of outcomes from future data. 

Classical programming takes in rules and data to produce answers. Ex. TurboTax software.

Machine learning takes in data (and sometimes answers/labels for some data) and produces rules or predictions for future data.

#### Types of Machine Learning

- Supervised = labeled data. Example is marking messages as spam to train a classifier
- Unsupervised = no labels or human provided answers
- Semi-supervised = mixture of supervised/unsupervised
- Reinforcement learning  = use algorithm A to "grade"  the results from algorithm B

### Main Challenges of Machine Learning

- Garbage in, garbage out
- Insufficient quantity of data
- Nonrepresentative data
- Poor quality data
- Overfitting or underfitting
- Bias in, bias out

### Setup your interactive learning environment

1. Create an account on `https://kaggle.com`
2. Go to `https://www.kaggle.com/ryanorsinger/intro-to-data-science`
3. Click "Fork" to make your own copy so you can experiment.
4. We will be running Python code inside a Jupyter Notebook

### Using Jupyter Notebooks

- Click into a cell to enter edit mode. You can edit text or edit code.
- `shift + enter` to run a cell of code. 
- Notebooks have command mode and edit mode
- From edit mode, type the `esc` key to enter command mode.
- Type `h` in command mode to get a list of keyboard shortcuts
